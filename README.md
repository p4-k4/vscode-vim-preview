# VSCode Vim Preview

A Visual Studio Code extension that provides a real-time preview of vim keybinding commands, acting as an interactive cheat sheet that responds to your keypresses.

## Features

- üîç Real-time preview of available vim commands and VSCODE keybinds
- ‚å®Ô∏è User-configurable trigger key
- ‚ö° Live filtering as you type
- üìù Support for custom binding descriptions
- üîé Search by keys, command IDs, or descriptions
- üöÄ Execute commands directly from the preview

## Usage

### Trigger the Preview
Two ways to access the keybindings preview:

1. Use the default shortcut: `ctrl+shift+v`
2. Open command palette (Cmd+Shift+P / Ctrl+Shift+P) and type "Show Vim Key Bindings Preview"

### Configure Custom Trigger Key
You can change the trigger key in VSCode settings:
1. Open Settings (Cmd+, / Ctrl+,)
2. Search for "VSCode Vim Preview"
3. Edit the "Trigger Key" setting
4. Enter your preferred key combination (e.g., "cmd+k cmd+v")

### Search and Execute Commands
Once the preview is open:
1. Type to filter available commands
2. Search by:
   - Key combinations (e.g., "ff" for leader+f+f)
   - Command IDs (e.g., "quickOpen")
   - Descriptions (if configured)
3. Press Enter to execute the selected command

## Custom Descriptions

You can add descriptions to your keybindings to make them more discoverable:

```json
"vim.normalModeKeyBindings": [
    {
        "description": "Write file",
        "before": [",", "w"],
        "commands": ["workbench.action.files.save"]
    },
    {
        "description": "Quick file search",
        "before": ["<leader>", "f", "f"],
        "commands": ["workbench.action.quickOpen"]
    }
]
```

The extension will use these descriptions in the preview interface, making it easier to find and understand your keybindings.
